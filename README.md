NEW WEBSITE FOR HUSKY RESCUE
============================

#### By Mariana Menezes, Aswin Sundararajan and Huang Stanley

## Overview

Our project is a non profit website.
It's a webpage to show more informations about Husky Rescue
organization and dogs adoption. The website intent is to
educate people about Huskies necessities and to give a new
home for dogs.  We decided to help them, because we believe
that we can improve their current version website and it was
the way that we thought to help some dogs. As participants from
Chingu Cohorts, we want to improve our expertise about programming.
